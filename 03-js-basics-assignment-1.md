# Orientation Course - Basics of JavaScript Programming

MP 9/2020

## JavaScript assignment 1

Recap lessons 1 & 2.

Make an application that simulates tossing a coin ([coin flipping in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping)).

- You will get readymade html, css and image files for the assignment (Check Oma).
- Develop your app by editing only the javascript file (`assignment.js`) which will contain all the code and application logic to implement this game
- **Do not modify the html file.** You can style your app by editing the css file if you want but _do not touch the html file!_

**NOTE:** This is an individual assignment, not a group assignment.

### Functional requirements

- record userâ€™s choice in the beginning (head or reverse)
- simulate tossing the coin by using random value generation
- show the result of the coin flip to user
  - display head or reverse image
  - tell user if his/her guess was correct
- record all results (use array(s)) and user's points
  - correct guess -> add 1 point
- display the coin flip result history and the user guess history
- user can toss the coin multiple times
- refreshing/reloading web page restarts the application (clears result history, etc.)
- print all output values to console too

### Returning

- Check instructions in Oma assignments
- upload the application to your _public_html/_ and return working a web link to Oma
- return your assignment.js file to Oma (only js file, no need for html or css)

### Grading

0-5 p.

- Working application and all functionalities implemented: 2 points
- Clean code and good coding practices followed: 1 p
- Proper use of control structures: 1 p
- Proper use of functions: 1 p
